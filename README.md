## **Purpose**

The purpose of this page is to display myself and my work as a web developer. This network of pages includes the main landing page, profile, contact page, and portfolio. This is the first of many iterations of this project.

----

## **Components**

Common to all pages are the header card, which displays my name; and the navbar at the bottom, which contains the links to the different pages. I have muted the text of the links to match the subdued look to the page.

----

### **Main Page**

The main page utilizes a carousel effect from Bootstrap. There are button controls that allow the user to view a specific slide. There is an image of me so people can see how thoughtful and trustworthy I am ;). There are also images that represent what I will be able to accomplish for them -- an online experience that is both nice to look at and easy to use.

### **Profile**

The profile page provides basic information about me and my interests. It includes a different thoughtful/trustworthy looking picture of me.

### **Contact** 

The contact page looks simple, but it was probably the most difficult to create. There is no single example of this page on Bootstrap so I had to pick and choose different elements from the Bootstrap page to make it appear as it is.

Perhaps the most important elements on this page are the links to my Github profile, LinkedIn, and I created a Facebook page for my web development. The latter will mostly be used to network my future freelance/contract endeavors, but I created it to create a larger network for the work I want to do.

### **Portfolio**

The portfolio page is essentially a placeholder at this point. It even utilizes images from placeholder.com to show the layout of the page as it develops over time ;).

## **What I've Learned**

Bootstrap is an incredibly powerful tool for beginner developers especially. It allows the developing developer to see the outcome, but also the code that lies behind it. This is very helpful, especially for visual learners. I've also learned that experimentation is important. It helps you learn how to lay out your code in a clean and intuitive way.
